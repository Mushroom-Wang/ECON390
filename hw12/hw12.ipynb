    "Consider an infinitely repeated duopoly market with stochastic demand. Specifically, firms 1 and 2 interact over time $t \\in\\{1, \\ldots, \\infty\\}$ with the demand in each time period being either high (H) or low (L). If the demand is $\\mathrm{H}$, then the inverse demand function is given by $p_{H}=120-q_{1}-q_{2} ;$ if the demand is $L,$ then the inverse demand function is given by $p_{L}=60-q_{1}-q_{2}$ (where $q_{1}$ is quantity chosen by firm $1,$ and $q_{2}$ is the quantity chosen by firm 2). Furthermore, suppose that firms discount the future according to the discount rate of $\\beta=.99$ and the demand evolves according to the transition probability matrix $M=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}.8 & .2 \\\\ .3 & .7\\end{array}\\right] .$ For example, the probability that the demand in period $t+1$ is $\\mathrm{H}$ given that the demand in period $t$ is $\\mathrm{H}$ is . $8 .$ For simplicity, suppose that each firm produces at zero marginal cost.\n",
